                <h2>First Article</h2>
                <p>Paragraph development begins with the formulation of the controlling idea. This idea directs the
                    paragraph’s development. Often, the controlling idea of a paragraph will appear in the form of a
                    topic sentence. In some cases, you may need more than one sentence to express a paragraph’s
                    controlling idea.</p>

                <h2>Second Article</h2>
                <p>Paragraph development continues with an expression of the rationale or the explanation that the
                    writer gives for how the reader should interpret the information presented in the idea statement or
                    topic sentence of the paragraph. The writer explains his/her thinking about the main topic, idea, or
                    focus of the paragraph.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>Third Article</h2>
                <p>Paragraph development progresses with the expression of some type of support or evidence for the
                idea and the explanation that came before it. The example serves as a sign or representation of the
                relationship established in the idea and explanation portions of the paragraph
